## Magico

Magico is a Sponge plugin that adds Spells to Sponge Minecraft servers.

### Debugging

If you're using IntelliJ and want to use the SpongeForge dev server to debug Magico, you need to include `magico_main`, `ormlite-core`, and `ormlite-jdbc` as dependencies for SpongeForge. (Under Project Structure -> Modules -> SpongeForge_api -> Add Library)
